INSTALLATION:

On Mac/Linux:  Copy the contents of the zip archive into the "NetLogo 4.1" application folder.  Everthing should end up in the "behaviorsearch" subfolder, within the NetLogo folder.

On Windows:  You should have already run the installer, which is why you're reading this.  (Hopefully you installed BehaviorSearch into a subfolder of the NetLogo folder.  Otherwise you'll need to uninstall it and try again.)

RUNNING:

If you want to use Behaviorsearch through the GUI, you can simply run the application (it's installed alongside the NetLogo application in NetLogo 6.0 and later).

If you want to run behaviorsearch headlessly, you must set the JAVA_HOME environment variable in your shell. Then run the behaviorsearch_headless script in the "behaviorsearch" directory. In Windows and linux, the behaviorsearch directory is located inside the "app" folder within the NetLogo installation.

Windows:  Run "app\behaviorsearch\behaviorsearch_headless.bat" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Mac: Run "behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.command" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Linux: Run "app/behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.sh" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
